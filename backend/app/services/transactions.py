"""Predictable transaction strategy (ARCHITECTURE §6): one transaction per service call.

Services needing atomicity wrap their session-taking coroutine with @transactional:
commit on success, rollback + re-raise on failure. Orchestrators needing atomicity
across several services skip the decorator, share one session, and commit once —
no code for that path until a caller needs it.
