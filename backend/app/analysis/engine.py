"""Deterministic analysis engine (Stage 07): detectors → dedup → score.

Pure functions over text (zero I/O, zero network, zero LLM). The pipeline:

1. Run every detector in `REGISTRY` order over one requirement.
2. Sort findings by span, then dedup:
   - exact duplicates (same detector + same span) collapse to one;
   - identical spans from DIFFERENT detectors collapse to the highest severity
     (ties break by registry order — structural detectors win).
   Overlapping-but-distinct spans are KEPT: e.g. "quickly" (subjective-term)
   and "respond quickly" (missing-measurable-criteria) are genuinely different
   concerns — the word is vague AND the claim is untestable.
3. Score: 100 − Σ severity deductions, clamped to 0–100.
4. Requirement severity = highest finding severity (None when clean).
5. Analysis score = arithmetic mean of requirement scores (half-up rounding);
   band + 4 health dimensions derive from the same deductions — no hidden
   weighting anywhere. The score is a heuristic indicator, not a validated
   measurement (see `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` §6).
